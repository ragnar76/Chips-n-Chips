Following is a list of the different failure codes for your SCSI-Drives.<BR>
Please be aware that any flash, other than one, means that the drive<BR>
needs to be sent in for repair.<BR>
The repair depot for EUROPE is in Amsterdam and can be reached via<BR>
telephone at (0)31-20-6533539 or via FAX at (0)31-20-6530890.<BR>

_Onboard Drive Diagnostics_<BR>
<BR>
At power-on the drive will execute a series of diagnostic tests. Any <BR>
failure will be indicated by a series of <A HREF="LEUCHTDIODE.html">LED</A> flashes. The first failure<BR>
will be preserved. Any power-up failure will result in sense code 29H,<BR>
an internal controller error and an additional power-on diagnostic code<BR>
in sense byte one. The drive is ready to read/write if no error codes are<BR>
received within 20 seconds. The failure codes and the test sequence <BR>
follow:<BR>
<BR>
*Microprocessor/Internal Memory Test:* Failure is indicated by one flash<BR>
and an additional sense code (byte one) of 31H.<BR>
<BR>
*Microprocessor ROM Checksum Test:* Failure is indicated by two flashes<BR>
and an additional sense code of 32H.<BR>
<BR>
*Controller Chip Test:* Failure to initialize correctly is indicated by<BR>
three flashes and an additional sense code of 33H.<BR>
<BR>
*Controller Program RAM Test:* Failure is indicated by four flashes and<BR>
an additional sense code of 84H (?; evtl. Fruckdehler)<BR>
<BR>
*Data Buffer RAM Test:* Failure is indicated by five flashes and an<BR>
additional sense code of 35H.<BR>
<BR>
*Spindle Speed Test:* If the drive is unable to reach and maintain correct<BR>
spindle speed, six flashes will be returned with an additional sense code<BR>
of 36H.<BR>
<BR>
*Read Operating System Microcode From Drive:* If the controller is unable<BR>
to read the operating system from the drive, eight flashes are returned <BR>
with an additional sense code of 88H (?; s.o.). If the controller reads<BR>
the operating system records, but determines that they are invalid, nine<BR>
flashes are returned with an additional sense code of 89H.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
_Incoming Inspection_<BR>
<BR>
This product family supports a self-test routine that Seagate recommends<BR>
for incoming inspection. This test may be run after the unit has<BR>
sucessfully passed the power-on diagnostics.<BR>
<BR>
_Enabling the Offline Self-Test Routines_<BR>
<BR>
To enable the test, short the following pins to ground at the SCSI<BR>
connector: 2, 12, 16 and 32.<BR>
<BR>
The self-test has three parts. They will cycle in order until power or a<BR>
grounding jumper is removed, or until 10 complete passes.<BR>
<BR>
The <A HREF="LEUCHTDIODE.html">LED</A> will remain on during the test and will turn *off* if an error is<BR>
detected or a jumper is removed. The <A HREF="LEUCHTDIODE.html">LED</A> will flash continuously if 10<BR>
passes are completed without error.<BR>
