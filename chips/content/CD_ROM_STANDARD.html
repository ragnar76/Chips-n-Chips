<U><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>CD-ROM Standards - COMPACT DISC FORMATS FOR MUSIC AND MULTIMEDIA<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT></U><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
 MIXED MODE <BR>
 compact discs contain multimedia data in TRACK 1 and audio in TRACKS <BR>
 2 - 99. This format requires the audio consumer to manually avoid <BR>
 TRACK 1 during playback and is therefore not considered a viable <BR>
 enhanced CD format. <BR>
 <BR>
 PREGAP/TRACK ZERO <BR>
 compact discs place the multimedia data in an expanded &quot;pregap&quot; area<BR>
 of the disc prior to TRACK 1 with the audio placed in its normal loca-<BR>
 tion starting at TRACK 1 [A.K.A. CD-ROM READY].<BR>
 This is currently the dominant format for enhanced CDs because it <BR>
 requires no special hardware or software drivers. <BR>
 <BR>
 STAMPED MULTISESSION <BR>
 compact discs contain two discrete &quot;sessions&quot; or areas of the disc that<BR>
 are completely seperate from each other. The audio &quot;session&quot; is placed<BR>
 on the innermost portion of the disc and the multimedia &quot;session&quot; oc-<BR>
 cupies the outermost area of the same disc. CDs in this format require<BR>
 special &quot;multisession&quot; capable CD-ROM drives and software in order to<BR>
 access the multimedia tracks and suffer reduced performance compared to<BR>
 traditional CD-ROMs due to the placement of the data near the outside<BR>
 edge of the disc.<BR>
