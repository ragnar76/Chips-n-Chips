 CD PLUS is a term used by SONY and PHILIPS to describe an enhanced CD <BR>
 that adheres to the BLUE BOOK specification [see above] Full length CD<BR>

 software. <BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
 COMPATIBILITY QUESTIONS<BR>
 <BR>
 Due to the complex nature of computers and the rapid pace of technolo-<BR>
 gical innovation, enhanced CDs, of all formats, are not universally <BR>
 compatible with every CD-ROM configuration...there are some difficul-<BR>
 ties. The following information addresses some of the known problems<BR>
 with enhanced CDs:<BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
 MIXED MODE enhanced suffer from the &quot;TRACK 1&quot; problem which requires <BR>
 the user to avoid playing the first track in a CD player. These discs<BR>
 are compatible with most CD-ROM drives but force major compromises on<BR>
 the audio user. <BR>
 <BR>
 CD PLUS enhanced CDs work well in CD audio players but pose several <BR>
 new challenges for the CD-ROM user. CD PLUS discs require &quot;multises-<BR>
 sion&quot; capable CD-ROM drives and special software drivers. The place-<BR>
 ment of the interactive components on the outside perimeter of the disc<BR>
 causes slower access times and occaisional tracking problems. These <BR>
 discs are compatible with 100% of audio players, 65% of MPC CD-ROM <BR>
 drives and 65% of MAC CD-ROM drives.<BR>
